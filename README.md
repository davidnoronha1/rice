# RICE
When cloning this repo, please clone with submodules `git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/undefinedDarkness/rice` or if you have already cloned, run `git submodule update --init --recursive`
Also please clone it to `~/rice`, many paths are coded to expect the repo to be there

## Requirements
- awesomewm (see below)
- playerctl & playerctl gir for bling to load
- wezterm ~ you need some kind of terminal, this is what I use but you can easily swap it out ig
- nvim ~ a modern version should just work technically (see below)
- dmenu ~ or you can use something else 
- mkr (see below)
- xclip
- picom (this one's important)

For `notion-dashboard` and many other scripts to work, you will need `python3-gi` installed
To build awesome and others you'll need `build-essential cmake meson libgtk-3-dev`

## Installation
once you have all the requirements, installation is pretty much just symlinking folders from `~/rice/.config` to `~/.config`

## Special Notes

## notion-dashboard
You will need to modify the script `~/rice/scripts/notion-dashboard.py` to match your notion, the rest should be okay

You'll need `convert` (imagemagick) for the blurred background - NOTE TO SELF, Consider only depending on ffmpeg

## dmenu
```
cd rice/misc/dmenu
sudo make install
```

### Mkr
Mkr is my custom launcher and you'll have to build it or swap it out with rofi or the like, To build it:
```
cd rice/misc/mkr
meson setup build
meson compile -C build
```

Might rip it out later, I dunno

### Neovim
Please do `:TSInstall` for any languages you often use or it won't look quite right, besides that it should just work,
It's just a standard lazy.nvim setup

I think you might need `rg` installed for telescope to work properly

### Awesome
This rice uses a custom build of awesome with a few patches applied which you can find in misc/
On Ubuntu, you need to 
1. clone awesome source code
2. apply the patch
3. install build dependencies
   `sudo apt-get build-dep awesome`
   for this you will need to enable source code repos, by either modifying `/etc/apt/sources.list` or using the additional software menu
4. Run the build  commands:
```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
make package
sudo apt install ./*.deb
```

Refer to awesomewm documentation for building if you get stuck

## Credits
this rice wouldn't be possible w/o awesome wm, bling and rubato
