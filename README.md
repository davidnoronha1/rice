# Dotfiles {Gruvbox Material Edition}
Welcome to my .config files, have some calming soup üç≤

## Installation
I have tried to make it as simple as possible, the following snippet should work
```sh
git clone https://github.com/undefinedDarkness/rice.git
cd rice
make push
```
This will install fonts and symlink (with `cp -r -s`) the configurations to their rightful locations
It will also check for required software

#### If you encounter any issues with installation, please make a issue 

## Software
I use most of the following software becuase I find it either interesting or the best for its purpose
- **Editor:** Emacs ~ I have also configured neovim
- **Distro:** Fedora ~ Its the most stable distro ive ever used & everything just works ‚Ñ¢Ô∏è 
- **Window Manager**: Awesomewm ~ Simply the best (& most customizable) window manager on X11
- **Web Browser**: Firefox ~ It mostly works well enough for my needs and I dont see the point of a *minimal* web-browser
- **Terminal**: [Wezterm](https://wezfurlong.org/wezterm/index.html) ~ Stuffed to the gills with features, reasonably fast, overall a really nice terminal

You need emacs (27+) to be compiled with [native comp](https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/GccEmacs), My config might work without it but no guaratees
In addition to awesomewm I also use the [bling utilities](https://github.com/BlingCorp/bling/) that provide some neat extensions that are really neat

Here's a list of other cool software I like:
- [Eww](https://github.com/elkowar/eww/): epic widget system that works in every wm (+ wayland)
- [Suckless Terminal](https://st.suckless.org/): The only suckless software I care about, [here](https://github.com/siduck76/st) is a nice pre-patched verison

- [Sarasa Gothic](https://github.com/be5invis/Sarasa-Gothic): Most of my rice uses this font family (Sarasa Term K & Sarasa UI HC)
- [Victor Mono](https://rubjo.github.io/victor-mono/): Ive slowly started using small bits of this font because it has really fancy italics
- [Merriweather](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Merriweather): I use this only for org and markdown mode in emacs

## Inspiration
Not all of these are inspiration some are just good

- [JavaCafe's Awesomewm](https://github.com/JavaCafe01/awedots) - 90% of my awesomewm config is just his but refurbished, great resource
- [Bunny's Emacs](https://github.com/rayes0/emacs/) - Splash screen and general design stolen from here
- [f2k's Emacs](https://github.com/fortuneteller2k/.emacs.d/) - How to make emacs go brr

Ill write more as I come up with them
