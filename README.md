<p align="center"><i>~ üç≤ Welcome to my dotfiles  ~</i></p>

My dotfiles are based on the [awesome window manager](https://awesomewm.org/apidoc/) and meant to be as easy & intuitive as possible for me to use üòÑ, Because I hate remembering stuff.
**Limitations:** Keybinds and productivity in general is very basic, and my rice is very focused on just having a single 1600x900 screen so it wont work well on larger screens.

### Design
My rice is very focused around the [gruvbox-material](https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material) colorscheme.

#### Inspiration
  JavaCafe's rice has been a great resource and inspiration                                 
 and many parts have come from there and undergone modification                            
([https://github.com/JavaCafe01/awedots](https://github.com/JavaCafe01/awedots))                                                   
                                                                                         
bunny's herbsluft rice has been an inspiration for the sidebar, dashboard etc             
([https://github.com/rayes0/dotfiles](https://github.com/rayes0/dotfiles))                                                      

no37's rice has been inspiration for the vertical bar and some sidebar design             
([https://github.com/Nooo37/dots](https://github.com/Nooo37/dots))                                                          

 Cool stuff:                                                                      

Bling is an awesome library if you use awesomewm, it includes several high-quality   
widgets and many ease-of-use / window management features  
It is used very extensively in my rice for tabbed / tag preview / task preview  
([https://github.com/BlingCorp/bling](https://github.com/BlingCorp/bling))                                                      

 Elkowar's Eww is a widget framework that can be used to create amazing widgets in any wm!           
([https://github.com/elkowar/eww/](https://github.com/elkowar/eww/))                                                         

 Elkowar's Phocus is a very nice gtk theme (for gruvbox)           
 and I have recreated its pretty window buttons for my rice
