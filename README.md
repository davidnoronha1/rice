  <h1>üçô My Awesome Rice.</h1>
</center>

Hello :wave: and thank you for dropping by,
these are the dotfiles for my Ubuntu based rice using the [awesome](awesomewm.org/) window manager

As of 1 May 2021, My rice uses [gruvbox material](https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material) as the primary colorscheme.
```
primary:
  background: '#1d2021'
  foreground: '#d4be98'
normal:
  black:   '#32302f'
  red:     '#ea6962'
  green:   '#a9b665'
  yellow:  '#d8a657'
  blue:    '#7daea3'
  magenta: '#d3869b'
  cyan:    '#89b482'
  white:   '#d4be98'
```

## Installation
I have attempted to make the installation as clean as possible.
So all you need to do is clone this repo and then run `install.sh`

You will need the following things:
-  Awesomewm (Window Manager)
-  Neovim (Editor)
-  Some hardware monitering tools (Detailed in install script)
-  st (Thats what my awesome config uses you can change it obviously)
-  dmenu
-  maim / [xcolor](https://github.com/Soft/xcolor) / xclip for screenshots & colorpicking

If you encounter any major issues, feel free to make a issue
